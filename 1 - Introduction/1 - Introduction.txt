JavaFX is a Java-based framework and library used for building rich, interactive, and visually appealing user interfaces (UIs) for desktop applications, web applications, and mobile applications. It provides a set of tools and APIs for creating GUI applications with various UI controls, multimedia support, graphics rendering, animation capabilities, and more. JavaFX was introduced by Oracle as a replacement for Swing, another Java GUI toolkit.

Key features of JavaFX include:

1. Scene Graph: JavaFX uses a hierarchical scene graph to represent the UI components and their relationships. This approach allows for efficient rendering and manipulation of UI elements.

2. UI Controls: JavaFX provides a wide range of built-in UI controls like buttons, text fields, labels, tables, lists, and more. These controls are customizable and can be easily styled to match the application's design.

3. Styling and CSS: JavaFX supports styling UI components using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This enables developers to separate the visual presentation of the UI from its logic, making it easier to maintain and update the look and feel of the application.

4. Layout Management: JavaFX includes various layout managers that help in arranging and positioning UI components within containers. These layout managers simplify the process of creating responsive and dynamic UIs.

5. Graphics and Multimedia: JavaFX provides APIs for working with 2D and 3D graphics, images, and multimedia content. It supports animations, transformations, blending modes, and more.

6. Event Handling: JavaFX uses an event-driven programming model to handle user interactions and other events. Developers can attach event handlers to UI components to respond to actions like button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.

7. FXML: JavaFX supports FXML (FXML Markup Language), which is an XML-based language for defining the UI layout and structure. FXML allows developers to separate the UI design from the Java code by specifying the UI components and their properties in a declarative manner.

8. Rich Text Support: JavaFX includes support for rendering rich text, allowing developers to apply different font styles, colors, and effects to text content.

9. Integration: JavaFX can be integrated with other Java technologies and libraries. It's commonly used in combination with Java applications, Java EE (Enterprise Edition) applications, and other frameworks.

10. Platform Independence: JavaFX applications can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and even embedded systems.

To get started with JavaFX, you typically need to include the necessary libraries in your project and then create UI components using Java code or FXML. The JavaFX libraries are included with the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) versions 7 and later.
