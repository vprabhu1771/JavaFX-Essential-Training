In IntelliJ IDEA, if your `dashboard.fxml` is located in the `resources/application package`, you can obtain its actual path using the following method:

src
└── main
    └── resources
        └── application
            └── dashboard.fxml


```java
String path = getClass().getResource("/application/dashboard.fxml").toExternalForm();
System.out.println("Dashboard FXML Path: " + path);
```

In your `MainController`, you can use this code to print the actual path of the `dashboard.fxml` to the console. Ensure that you run this code after the FXML file has been loaded.

If you want to load the FXML file using `FXMLLoader`, you can use the following code:

```java
@FXML
private void openDashboard(ActionEvent event) {
    try {
        FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource("/application/dashboard.fxml"));
        Parent root = loader.load();

        // Get the controller instance
        DashboardController dashboardController = loader.getController();

        // Set up your controller if needed
        // dashboardController.setupMethod(...);

        Stage stage = new Stage();
        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.setTitle("Dashboard");
        stage.show();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        // Handle the exception appropriately in a real-world scenario
    }
}
```

Note that the path used in `getResource` should start with a forward slash (`/`) to indicate the root of the classpath. The `application` in the path corresponds to the `application` package in your resources.

Remember to replace `DashboardController` with the actual name of your controller class if it's different.
